# MRI-Project
2018 Final Team Project

Miguel Flores, Ritik Mishra, Isaac AJ

This is a collection of proof-of-concept code and a place for testing out control systems.

Our product is a controllable RC boat. More info to come via a wiki.

It is likely that little code will show up here. Time permitting, there will be a lot of sensors and data that
will need to be processed and stored. We are still debating how that will be managed. Right now some ideas floating
around include a smartphone, Arduino, and/or Raspberry Pi. As for gathered data, that is also being discussed and
decided based on available resources.
